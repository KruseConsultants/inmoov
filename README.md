My Inmoov mod and code
Welcome, These video eyes are in no way a replacment for Gaels great Inmoov eyes design, simply a reverable cool Mod. Do with it as you will! 
If you would like to have your Inmoov have video eyes, you will need to following:

A teensy 3.2 (you can use almost any arduino but the provided code is based ont he Adafruit teensy 3.1 eyes project.
a volatge converter to ( I use a 6volt battery and the teensy and the screens are 3.3v.
2 video screens, I used a set from aliexpress, and provided a pin out to show you how to wire it up! 
Heres the screens I used:https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1-5-inch-7PIN-Full-Color-OLED-module-Display-Screen-SSD1351-Drive-IC-128-RGB-128/32850261706.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.4dfa4c4dBhC2eE
If you look atthe provised images, you can see I made a little PCB board to make the install small inside the Inmovv head. You do NOT need to make this like I did, but you will want a voltage controller step down if your over 5 volts on your Inmoov.

I did file the back of the eyes, (on the sides) of the 3d print of the inmoov after removing the eye mechinisim, and then simply hot glued the screens inot place. I am workjing on a design SLT to better have this fit.

If you have issue or questions, you can email me a jim@kruseconsultants.com and I will be happy to help!

Happy Inmooving!-James
